# What is Git?
Git is a text version tracking system. That is to say it keeps track of changes to files, including a full history of all prior states of the file (when used properly). While often associated with the website github, it can be used indepentendly on your own computer, hosted on a local server, or used with a variety of websites other than GitHub.

Repositories can be organized into folders just like the filesystem on your computer, and can contain any filetype, though it is best practice for a number of reasons to only include certain varities and categories of files, expanded further upon in the "best practices" section of this document.
